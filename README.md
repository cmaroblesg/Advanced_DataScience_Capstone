# Advanced DataScience Capstone
About this Course This project completer has proven a deep understanding on massive parallel data processing, data exploration and visualization, advanced machine learning and deep learning and how to apply his knowledge in a real-world practical use case where he justifies architectural decisions, proves understanding the characteristics of different algorithms, frameworks and technologies and how they impact model performance and scalability.
Please note: You are requested to create a short video presentation at the end of the course. This is mandatory to pass. You don't need to share the video in public.

Please refer to **Codes** folder to check the development.
  * COVID_Databases is the ETL development (Extract, Transform and Load)
  * COVID_Analysis is the forecasting analysis (Facebook Prophet, Time Series and SARIMAX)

In the **Documents** folder you could find the presentation and the "Lightweight_IBM Cloud_Garage_Method_for_Data_Science_Mexican-COVID-Analysis.docx" file with a brief analysis for the main project.
